This is an example of a separate file that could be included as a results file if you don't want to bloat your quiz page.

Just make up some fragment as HTML response and load it here.

If you don't want to keep on writing HTML by hand, you can also write some MarkDown stuff and use a converter script to make them into valid HTML.

You can even [include awesome stuff like links](https://pinguiminvestidor.com) here, how awesome is that?
