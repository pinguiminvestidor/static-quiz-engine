<p>This is an example of a separate file that could be included as a results file if you don't want to bloat your quiz page.</p>

<p>Just make up some fragment as HTML response and load it here.</p>

<p>If you don't want to keep on writing HTML by hand, you can also write some MarkDown stuff and use a converter script to make them into valid HTML.</p>

<p>You can even <a href="https://pinguiminvestidor.com">include awesome stuff like links</a> here, how awesome is that?</p>
