# Internet Quiz Engine for GitHub Pages

 - Online quiz in static HTML and Javascript hosted in github
 - Depending on the score, give them a different page from the blog to visit it.
 - Give them a "badge" to share in social media (yes, this is very early 2000s).
 - Send them off to buy the book or sign up to the main website!

## Method

Vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript, after all, this is all Github pages.

Use a state machine or similar pattern to record scores, and grade the user in the end.

May make use of AJAX, as needed. Likewise jQuery.

May display different CTAs depending on score.
